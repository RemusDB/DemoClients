<p>Welcome to this lesson on asking the right questions. In this lesson you’ll learn how to ask the right questions that will make the most out of your analysis and get the insights you need for decision making. Asking the right questions is the best way to get your data-driven decision making process started!</p>

<p>Let’s take another look at the data-driven decision making framework.</p>

<p>The framework does not start with acquiring the data. Asking questions is the first phase in the process. Having effective questions to start the data-driven decision making process with will help you to formulate the right business question.</p>

<p>When you have the right business question you can narrow it down to your analysis goal. In turn, you can use your analysis goal to come up with hypotheses, which you can prove or disprove in your analysis. We’ll get to the analysis goals and hypothesis in the next lessons. </p>

<p>For now, let’s take a closer look at how to get to the business question.</p>

<p>You can start by following the traditional six-question framework: what, who, when, where, why and how.</p>

<p>With these questions you can identify the problem you are trying to solve and understand the context of the problem. The context is where you start: What actually happened and why are you interested in solving it? What is the problem or opportunity you have at hand. 

After that you can drill down further on the segment you are interested in: When did the problem or opportunity take place and where did it happen? Who is impacted by it? 

Finally, you can go deeper into potential reasons behind the problem: What might have caused the problem and what do you think drives the problem? </p>

<p>After better understanding the problem and its context you can go deeper into the decision-making around the problem. What decision needs to be made by when? Is this an urgent problem or can it wait? 

And what type of actions are being taken based on the analysis. Is this a one-time action for which you need an ad-hoc analysis or do you expect recurring actions? When recurring actions are needed a dashboard would be the right solution. 

Finally you need to know who is the decision maker. Are you in charge of making the decision, do you need to communicate the decision to others or do you need to influence others to make a decision?</p>

###### Question

<p>As an operations analyst at Just Eat Takeaway, you want to understand how many orders were placed last month for pizza, sushi and indian food. What type of analytical problem type are you trying to solve?</p>

###### Option #1

<p>Making predictions</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>Not quite. Predicting the most popular takaways would be an example of making predictions.</p>

###### Option #2

<p>Categorizing things</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>That’s correct! When you are dividing your orders into pizza, sushi or indian food, you are categorizing things.</p>

###### Option #3

<p>Spotting something unusual</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>Not exactly. An example of something unusual would be an abnormally higher number of orders in a specific timeframe.</p>

###### Hint

<p>Out ot the 6 problem types above, try to understand under which one would fee income across multiple client types fall into.</p>

<p>Hi and welcome to the FoodTiger supermarkets Power BI fundamentals course!</p>
<p>My name is Remus and I will be your instructor throughout this course that will boost your data-driven decision making skills by leveraging on data visualization</p>
<p>The key objective of the course is to enable you to take decisions with confidence using visual insights by following a data-driven framework.</p>
<p>You will be able to answer questions like: how to boost my sales, which products to promote or how clients decide what to buy AND THEN ACT based on this answers.</p>
<p>The course is divided into 4 chapters</p>
<p>Let's now deep-dive into the first chapter</p>
<p>Hi and welcome to the first chapter!</p>
<p>In this first chapter you will learn what Power BI is and how it can be used to generate visual insights with your data.</p>
<p>You will do this gradually, first finding out: What are the key components and building blocks of Power BI Afterwards, you will the explore Power BI most used visualizations and learn which one should be used when Then, at the end of the chapter, you will already be able to create you first visualizations in Power BI</p>
<p>But first, let’s start with the answer to the first question: What is Power BI and what can it be used for?</p>
<p>Power BI is a business analytics service developed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>At FoodTiger supermarkets we use it to provide interactive data visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.</p>
<p>It enables you to interactively explore data to get insights via easy-to-use visualizations.</p>
<p>Visually representing data enables you to identify patterns and take decision fast.</p>
<p>At FoodTiger supermarkets we use Power BI to ingest data from different sources and then visually represent this data.</p>
<p>This data from multiple sources is then transformed into: Monthly sales evolution Which you can then drill-down on a product line basis OR analyze most frequently used payment method</p>
<p>Now that you are more familiar with Power BI, let’s now explore what are the key building blocks.</p>
<p>After you understand these building blocks, you can expand on each of them and begin creating elaborate and complex reports</p>
<p>This building blocks are:</p>
<p>Visualizations Datasets Reports Dashboards</p>
<p>Let’s now tackle each of these building blocks and explain what they refer to.</p>
<p>Visualization - sometimes also referred to as a visual - is a visual representation of data, like a chart, a color-coded map, or other interesting things you can create to represent your data visually. Power BI has all sorts of visualization types, and more are coming all the time.</p>
<p>The image you see right now shows a collection of different visualizations that were created in the Power BI.</p>
<p>A dataset is a collection of data that Power BI uses to create its visualizations.</p>
<p>At FoodTiger we use data from mainly 2 sources:</p>
<p>From our SQL data warehouse (where we store sales per each store and sku AND also keep inventory) Or from different Excel files (where we store client feedback gathered in-store)</p>
<p>A dashboard is a single screen with interactive visuals, text, and graphics. A dashboard collects your most important metrics, on one screen, to tell a story or answer a question. The dashboard content comes from one or more reports and one or more datasets.</p>
<p>A dashboard is a single canvas that has tiles, graphics, and text.</p>
<p>A report is one or more pages of interactive visuals, text, and graphics that together make up a single report. Power BI bases a report on a single dataset. Often, the designer organizes report pages to address a central area of interest or answer a single question.</p>
