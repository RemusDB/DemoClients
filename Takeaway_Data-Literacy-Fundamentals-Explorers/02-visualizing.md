<p>Welcome to this lesson on asking the right questions. In this lesson you’ll learn how to ask the right questions that will make the most out of your analysis and get the insights you need for decision making. Asking the right questions is the best way to get your data-driven decision making process started!</p>

<p>Let’s take another look at the data-driven decision making framework.</p>

<p>The framework does not start with acquiring the data. Asking questions is the first phase in the process. Having effective questions to start the data-driven decision making process with will help you to formulate the right business question.</p>

<p>When you have the right business question you can narrow it down to your analysis goal. In turn, you can use your analysis goal to come up with hypotheses, which you can prove or disprove in your analysis. We’ll get to the analysis goals and hypothesis in the next lessons. </p>

<p>For now, let’s take a closer look at how to get to the business question.</p>

<p>You can start by following the traditional six-question framework: what, who, when, where, why and how.</p>

<p>With these questions you can identify the problem you are trying to solve and understand the context of the problem. The context is where you start: What actually happened and why are you interested in solving it? What is the problem or opportunity you have at hand. 

After that you can drill down further on the segment you are interested in: When did the problem or opportunity take place and where did it happen? Who is impacted by it? 

Finally, you can go deeper into potential reasons behind the problem: What might have caused the problem and what do you think drives the problem? </p>

<p>After better understanding the problem and its context you can go deeper into the decision-making around the problem. What decision needs to be made by when? Is this an urgent problem or can it wait? 

And what type of actions are being taken based on the analysis. Is this a one-time action for which you need an ad-hoc analysis or do you expect recurring actions? When recurring actions are needed a dashboard would be the right solution. 

Finally you need to know who is the decision maker. Are you in charge of making the decision, do you need to communicate the decision to others or do you need to influence others to make a decision?</p>

##### Task: Most popular takeaway choices
type: multichoice
answer: 2

###### Question

<p>As an operations analyst at Just Eat Takeaway, you want to understand how many orders were placed last month for pizza, sushi and indian food. What type of analytical problem type are you trying to solve?</p>

###### Option #1

<p>Making predictions</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>Not quite. Predicting the most popular takaways would be an example of making predictions.</p>

###### Option #2

<p>Categorizing things</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>That’s correct! When you are dividing your orders into pizza, sushi or indian food, you are categorizing things.</p>

###### Option #3

<p>Spotting something unusual</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>Not exactly. An example of something unusual would be an abnormally higher number of orders in a specific timeframe.</p>

###### Hint

<p>Out ot the 6 problem types above, try to understand under which one would fee income across multiple client types fall into.</p>
