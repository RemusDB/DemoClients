##### Content

<p>In this lesson we will mainly focus on building different types of visualizations and at the same time learn more about the Foodtiger supermarkets sales data.</p>

<p>Sometimes a single number is the most important KPI you want to track in your dashboard - such as profit, total number or orders or total sales</p>

<p>For this, letâ€™s use a type of visualization called card. 
Go to the Visualizations Panel and select the card. 
Now we go to the Fields Panel and drag the Total Profit to the Field section. And voila - FoodTiger Supermarkets generated 224k profit.</p>

<p>Similarly, letâ€™s now look at the total number of orders and sales.  We create 2 new cards and add the corresponding data.
Now letâ€™s deep-dive to better understand which are the regions which had the most significant impact in terms of sales. We will use a vertical bar chart for this.
Go to the Visualization Panel and select the Clustered column chart : Add Region to Axis and then add Total Sales to Values section.
To make the visual self-explanatory, we can also add data labels to it by enabling the Data labels options from the Format panel. </p>

<p>Itâ€™s very easy to change the visualization type from a vertical to a horizontal barchart.</p>

<p>As you can see in the char, the East region generated 0.59 millions in sales.
But how much from this was generated by each Product Category?
We can find this out by adding a stacked vertical bar chart and dragging the columns we need</p>

<p>Letâ€™s also enable the data labels.The West region sells 41.5% vegetables, which is the highest among all 4 regions.You can play around with changing the visualization type and choose the one that best suits your storyline.</p>

<p>Finally, letâ€™s deep-dive into the payment methods used by customers when purchasing at FoodTiger Supermarkets.Add a pie chart and drag the corresponding columns from the Fields section</p>

<p>So 34% of the customers prefer to pay for their groceries via their smartphone by using Apple Pay. Awesome, right?</p>

<p>Now that you have a good understanding on how to build basic dashboards, letâ€™s practice with some hands-on exercises!</p>
