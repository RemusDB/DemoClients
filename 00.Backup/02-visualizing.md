type: quiz
answer: 3

##### Context

<p>You can add a multichoice quiz question in the course. The question has some reading and then the proper question. For example</p>

<p>You might, or might not, have heard about <b>recursion</b> before. In either case, it's good to clarify what it is first.</p>

##### Task: Example open-ended question
type: multichoice
answer: 2

###### Question

<p>A data-driven decision process starts with asking the right question and understanding the problem. As a Assortment Manager at FoodTiger Supermarkets you would like to know what share of your assortment is provided by what supplier. What type of analytical problem are you trying to solve?</p>

###### Option #1

<p>Making predictions</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>Not quite. Predicting the effectiveness of your promotion campaign would be an example of making predictions.</p>

###### Option #2

<p>Categorizing things</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>Thatâ€™s correct! When you are looking into reasons why an order gets returned you are categorizing things.</p>

###### Option #3

<p>Spotting something unusual</p>

####### Option Feedback

<p>Not exactly. An example of something unusual would be an abnormally high transaction which might cause that a FoodTiger branch would run out of stock unexpectedly.</p>

###### Hint

<p>Choose one of the provided options.</p>
