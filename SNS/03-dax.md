##### Content

<p>In this lesson you will explore and learn how to build your first dashboard in Tableau.</p>

<p>By the end of the course you will be able to create a dashboard in Tableau similar like this in which you will be able to analyse KPIs like: Total number of orders in a specific timeframe, Average delivery time, Cuisine distribution
or Top Rated restaurants</p>

<p>First, letâ€™s start with looking at the order data to better understand it. As you can see, in our table we have details like:
Order id, Restaurant Name, Total Price or Distance from restaurant.</p>

<p>You can also play around with the filters to sort your data ascending or descending:
By rating to find our top rated restaurants
By price to find out the highest or lowest order value
Or by distance to find out how far were the customers from the restaurants</p>

<p>To build a visualisation, you first need to create an empty workbook and then drag and drop the corresponding data that you need. For instance: if you drag the Restaurant Name to the Columns part and then you drag the Average Rating measure to the rows part, you can easily build a bar chart and spot which were the top rated restaurants.</p>

<p>As you can see in the char, the East region generated 0.59 millions in sales.
But how much from this was generated by each Product Category?
We can find this out by adding a stacked vertical bar chart and dragging the columns we need</p>

<p>Also, you can play around with the sorting to slice and dice your data.
Even more, you can change the visualisation type so that you can choose the best storyline for you. Awesome, right?</p>
